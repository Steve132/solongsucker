This document outlines the production of the So Long Sucker simulation.  This software will allow any user to simulate a real world game of So Long Sucker in a virtual environment using a computer.  This simulation allows for interaction between simulated players using the computer as a virtual environment.  The idea of the simulation is that computerized intelligences will be able to perform the same actions they would in a real game as in the simulation.  The benefits of this system are that it allows clients to create and simulate artificial games of So Long Sucker, with different combinations of bargaining strategies.  By examining the result of many games with many combinations of strategy, the user may determine the optimimum bargaining strategy.

Despite all the benefits, there are limitations to a simulation.  Not everything that can be performed in the real world can be performed in the virtual world.  For example, the simulation created here does not allow for complex bargaining, such as multiple-player bargains.  In the real world game, the possibilities for bargaining are infinite.  Unfortunately, this will not be modeled in the virtual world.

Another limitation of playing the game in a virtual environment is the ability to read other players' facial expressions and body language.  This can be important when making a bargain with another player since any player has the option to go back on any bargain without penalty.  So, the practice of bluffing for a computer player may not be nearly as effective when dealing with a simulation.
