	Project Motivation and objectives;

	Nash Simulations, Inc. , (hereafter referred to as “Nash Sims”), has observed a number of
its most valuable employees become fed up with company practices regarding software
development, and many of them have left for greener pastures at many of their
competitors. Additionally, many of those whom Human Resources (HR) has convinced
to stay, (even those not as valuable to the team) enjoy massively overweighted salaries
and bonuses. In the face of decreased product quality and increasing labor costs, upper
management tasked Research to investigate this problem. After performing a detailed
internal investigation into the details of HR, Research employees discovered that
45%-65% of the employee defection cases could have been resolved with more effective
and more competitive employment offers. In addition, 70% of the employees whom
Upper Management identified as likely overcompensated were, in fact overcompensated.
Of these, 10% were overcompensated due to payroll errors (with a fix to be suggested in
document A4352), and 90% were overcompensated due to middle management fear of
social rejection and lack of confidence to reject employee demands.
        As a means of solving this problem, Research decided to come up with a way to
better train HR staff to bargain with potential and current employees. Additionally, they
have decided to lay the groundwork for future work training an artificial intelligence
system to effectively bargain for resources with potential applicants automatically.
Therefore, Researchers decided that a simulation of a simple game based on economics
professor John Nash's thesis work with collective bargaining would be the best choice as
a general framework to teach the tools required. The specific game chosen, called So
Long Sucker, was chosen, because it is well known to the Research team, was created by
John Nash himself, and is well-known for the bargaining behavior it teaches, as well as
the ability to break and create bargains.
The remainder of this section and the next present a functional description and external
design of the So Long Sucker Simulation, the proposed game designed to achieve the
business goals recommended by Nash Simulations Research team.
