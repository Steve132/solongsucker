The intent of this simulator is to provide all players with an interactive way to play a real life game within a virtual world.  If a user is interested in playing a game of So Long Sucker, but has no one to play with, then a simulator can be a great alternative.  For this reason, the So Long Sucker simulator will have the ability to be implement over a LAN or any internet connection, connecting players of all types across the globe.  The software currently runs on all desktop platforms.  However, future releases of the simulator will be ported to run on all mobile devices.

Our research department is looking into implementing some hardware designed specifically for the game.  This hardware is a cutting edge technology that will place all players into a virtual world.  The idea is that each player will be able to see each other's facial expressions and body language.  This will go a long way into making the game more user friendly.  It has the possiblity to take away the downside of not being able to bluff in the current simulation to providing a whole new benefit to allow players of the game to feel as though they are at the same table as another player on the other side of the world.
