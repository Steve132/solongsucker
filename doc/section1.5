Document Overview
Author: Andrew

The rest of the documentation will be provided as follows:

	System Overview
This section details the basics of the simulation.  It goes into detail about some of the background involved and the objectives for implementing the simulator.  It summarizes the rules of the game.  Then, a comprehensive overview of the entire virtual world model will be provided.  By way of a use case diagram and activity diagram, it will explain the interactions between actors and possible scenarios.  A detailed model of the simulator will be provided in this section, along with the assumptions and dependencies relating to things outside of the virtual world.


	External Interface
This section gives a detailed description of the input and output file specifications.  These descriptions will provide enough guidelines so that one would be able to construct a proper input file and interpret the data and messages in the output file.  An interactive user interface specification that provides details and a screenshot for all the prompts in the interface will also be included in this section.

	Internal Software
This section provides a breakdown of all the software specifications.  It will deal with an overview of the architecture including static and dynamic models.  A system class diagram will be included for the static models and a System Activity Diagram and an Agent Communication Diagram will be included to represent the dynamic models.  Finally, a detailed description of each class, including its package, type, data members, methods, protocols, and its subclasses will be provided.


	Implementation
This section highlights a summary of the progress of the overall simulation so far.  It will provide a list of things learned through the practice of implementation.  It will also detail the restrictions for executing the simulation as well as providing a sample input and output file that could be utilized in the simulation.
