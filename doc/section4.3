Name: Bargain
Type: Entity
Purpose: Bargain exists to provide a basis of communication between existing Players in the simulation.  A Player can offer a set of Chips in hopes of getting the next turn and requesting a move or the Player in turn could offer to perform a move and give the turn to a player, provided that they give them a certain number of Chips.
Data Members: MoveProposal move, multiset<Chip> chips, Chip nextTurn
Methods:	public Bargain()
		public Bargain(MoveProposal move, multiset<Chip> chips, Chip nextTurn)
		public ~Bargain()

Name: BargainMsg
Type: Boundary
Purpose: BargainMsg exists to provide a method of the discrete simulator of So Long Sucker to inform players of Bargains to be passed between them.
Data Members: int handler, string description, Bargain bargain
Methods:	public BargainMsg(int handler, string description)
		public BargainMsg(int handler, string description, Bargain& bargain)
		public ~BargainMsg()

Name: Board
Type: Entity
Purpose: Board exists as a container for Piles.
Data Members: list<Pile> piles
Methods:	public Board()
		public ~Board()

Name: Chip
Type: Entity
Purpose: Chip exists as both a Player identification color and as tokens for play in Piles.

Name: ChipMsg
Type: Boundary
Purpose: ChipMsg exists to provide a method of the discrete simulator of So Long Sucker to inform Players when it is their next turn or to inform the Player in turn of the available Players to select for the next turn, according to rules.

Name: MoveProposal
Type: Entity
Purpose: MoveProposal acts a way to indicate what move the Player intends to take.
Data Members: Chip chip, list<Pile>::iterator pile
Methods:	public MoveProposal()
		public MoveProposal(Chip chip, list<Pile>::iterator pile)
		public ~MoveProposal()

Name: NancyNice
Type: Control

Methods:	public Pile()
		public ~Pile()

Name: Player
Type: Control
Purpose: Player is a subclass of Agent and provides a main actor for play during the simulation.
Data Members: Hand hand, Chip chipId
Methods:	public Player()

		public ~SoLongSucker()

		public void Initialize();
		public void Simulate();
		public void WrapUp();

		public Message* AcceptChipsDiscard(multiset<Chip> chips);
