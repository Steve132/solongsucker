This document outlines the production of the So Long Sucker simulation.  This software will allow any user to simulate a real world game of So Long Sucker in a virtual environment using a computer.  This simulation allows for interaction between human players using the computer as a virtual environment.  The idea of the simulation is that players will be able to perform the same actions they would in a real game as in the simulation.  The benefits of this are that it gives fans of the game another alternative to playing games in the real world.  It also gives the ability to connect players far apart through a computer, as opposed to all players having to be in the same room.

Despite all the benefits, there are limitations to a simulation.  Not everything that can be performed in the real world can be performed in the virtual world.  For example, the simulation created here does not allow for complex bargaining, such as multiple player bargains.  In the real world, the possibilities to a bargain are infinite.  Unfortunately, this cannot be moedeled in the virtual world.

Another limitation of playing the game in a virtual environment is the ability to read other players' facial expressions and body language.  This can be important when making a bargain with another player since any player has the option to go back on any bargain without penalty.  So, the practice of bluffing may not be nearly as effective when dealing with a simulation.
